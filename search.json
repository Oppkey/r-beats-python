This approach has led to significant breakthroughs, particularly in areas like cancer and immunology, where targeted therapies have been transformative. However, this model is not without its limitations. As Dr. Obermeyer pointed out, many complex medical problems remain unsolved, and the traditional bench-to-bedside approach has largely overshadowed the alternative pathway — one that begins with observations at the bedside."

    "text": "1.2 AI: A New Lens for Medical Discovery\nAI, with its ability to process vast amounts of data and detect patterns invisible to the human eye, offers a powerful alternative. Dr. Obermeyer provided compelling examples of how AI can generate novel empirical observations from real-world data, thereby reinvigorating the bedside-to-bench pathway.\n\n1.2.1 The Case of Knee Pain\nOne of the illustrative examples Dr. Obermeyer discussed was knee pain, a condition that has long eluded effective treatment through traditional molecular approaches. Historically, research on knee pain has zoomed in at a molecular level, focusing on inflammation markers and cartilage degradation. However, this approach has not significantly alleviated the widespread issue of knee pain, leading to an over-reliance on opioids as a treatment.\nDr. Obermeyer’s team leveraged AI to analyze knee X-rays, not to replicate human radiologist interpretations, but to predict patient-reported pain scores directly from the image data. This approach uncovered new insights into the anatomical and physiological factors contributing to knee pain, particularly among Black patients, thus addressing a known disparity in pain management and treatment outcomes.\n\n\n1.2.2 Sudden Cardiac Death: Predicting the Unpredictable\nAnother poignant example involved the use of AI to predict sudden cardiac death, a condition notorious for its unpredictability. By analyzing ECG data linked to patient outcomes in Sweden, Dr. Obermeyer’s team developed a model that could identify individuals at high risk of sudden cardiac death with greater accuracy than traditional metrics. This predictive capability has the potential to optimize the allocation of defibrillators, ensuring they reach those most in need."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the realm of public health, understanding and managing infectious diseases is crucial. This is particularly true for measles, a highly contagious virus that can lead to severe health complications. The recent R/Medicine 2025 conference shone a spotlight on an exemplary study conducted by Iko Musa, a master’s student from the University of Jos, Nigeria. His research, titled “Identifying Measles Immunity Gaps in the US: Analysis of Vaccination Coverage, Geographic Risk, and Future Outbreak Projections,” provides critical insights into the current state of measles immunity and vaccination in the United States.\n\n\nIko’s study addresses a timely issue: the declining measles vaccination rates in the U.S., which have dropped below the 95% threshold recommended for herd immunity. This decline poses a significant risk of outbreaks, making it imperative to understand where and why these gaps in immunity are occurring.\n\n\n\nTo tackle this issue, Iko formulated several research objectives: 1. Analyze the temporal trends of measles cases in the U.S. from 1990 to 2025. 2. Identify geographic areas at high risk. 3. Assess the influence of geographical factors on measles outbreaks. 4. Compare U.S. measles data with global trends. 5. Project future measles case trajectories and their potential health impacts. 6. Pinpoint immunity gaps where vaccination coverage falls below 95%.\nIko employed a variety of analytical tools to achieve these objectives: - Temporal trend analysis using ggplot2 for visualization. - Geospatial mapping with ggplot2 maps and other tools to identify high-risk areas. - Comparative analysis to juxtapose U.S. data against global trends. - Time series forecasting to predict future outbreaks.\n\n\n\nTemporal Trends - The analysis revealed significant fluctuations in measles cases over the years, with notable outbreaks occurring periodically since 1989. A worrying trend is the recent increase in cases from 2020 through 2025.\nGeographical Risk - High-risk areas predominantly lie in the Mountainous regions and southern parts of the U.S., with states like Texas showing particularly high numbers of cases.\nAge Distribution - Most cases occur in individuals under 20 years old, emphasizing sustained transmission among children and teenagers.\nGlobal Comparison - The proportion of peak quarterly cases shows that U.S. trends are generally consistent with global patterns, though some differences exist in seasonal peaks.\n\n\nCurrent vaccination rates are alarmingly below the necessary threshold for herd immunity (95%). Forecasting models indicate that a decrease in vaccination rates could lead to significantly higher numbers of measles cases under various scenarios.\n\n\n\n\nThe study underscores a critical need for targeted vaccination campaigns, especially focusing on school-aged children in high-risk states. Improving vaccination coverage by even 5% could prevent numerous cases and help restore herd immunity.\n\n\n\nIko Musa’s research not only highlights the challenges posed by declining measles vaccination rates but also provides a roadmap for intervention. His methodical approach and effective use of data visualization techniques make a compelling case for immediate public health action to close immunity gaps and protect communities across the United States.\n\n\n\nIko Musa is currently pursuing his Master’s degree in Field Epidemiology at the University of Jos, Nigeria. His academic focus is on community medicine, aiming to enhance public health through rigorous research and effective implementation of health policies. His work on measles immunity gaps has been recognized at R/Medicine 2025, reflecting his commitment to addressing critical global health issues through data-driven analysis.\nFor more information on R/Medicine and competition rules, please visit: - R/Medicine - Competition Rules"

    "text": "1.1 Why distanceHD?\nTraditional distance metrics such as Euclidean or Mahalanobis distances often falter in high-dimensional spaces. These conventional methods, while effective in lower dimensions, struggle to detect meaningful clusters or outliers when faced with the complexity of high-dimensional data. This gap is particularly evident in fields like genomics, where the number of features (variables) often exceeds the number of samples.\nThe distanceHD package introduces three innovative distance metrics designed for high-dimensional clustering and outlier detection: the centroid distance, ridge Mahalanobis distance, and maximal data piling (MDP) distance. Each of these metrics offers unique benefits, making them invaluable tools in the data scientist’s arsenal."

    "section": "1.2 The Three Pillars of distanceHD",
    "text": "1.2 The Three Pillars of distanceHD\n\n1.2.1 1. Centroid Distance\nCentroid distance, also known as Euclidean distance, calculates the distance between the centers of two groups. It is a straightforward metric but can be limited in high-dimensional spaces with correlated variables. However, it remains effective when variables are uncorrelated.\n\n\n1.2.2 2. Ridge Mahalanobis Distance\nThe ridge Mahalanobis distance introduces a ridge correction constant, alpha, to ensure the covariance matrix is invertible — a common issue in high-dimensional analysis due to singularity problems. This adjustment allows for a more stable calculation of distances, bridging the gap between the centroid and MDP distances. When alpha is large, the ridge Mahalanobis distance approximates the centroid distance, while a smaller alpha brings it closer to the MDP distance.\n\n\n1.2.3 3. Maximal Data Piling (MDP) Distance\nThe MDP distance is perhaps the most novel of the three metrics. It computes the orthogonal distance between the affine spaces spanned by each class, offering a unique direction vector that maximizes the distance between class projections. This metric shines in situations with highly correlated variables, such as gene expression data, and is particularly effective for classification problems."

    "text": "1.3 Practical Applications\nThe distanceHD package is not just a theoretical construct; it has real-world applications in clustering, classification, and outlier detection. For instance, in the context of outlier identification, the MDP distance can effectively discern outliers by maximizing the projection distance in a unique direction. This capability is demonstrated through sequential simulations, such as gene expression data with multiple features and patients, where traditional metrics may fall short.\nIn classification tasks, the MDP distance provides a high-dimensional, low-sample-size version of Fisher’s discriminant analysis, offering a powerful tool for binary predictions, such as disease status classification."

Despite measles being declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, recent years have seen its resurgence, largely attributable to declining vaccination rates.\nThrough meticulous data analysis, they highlighted a worrying trend: since 2020, median MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) coverage across U.S. states has fallen below the 95% threshold required for herd immunity. This decline corresponds with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, an event that significantly disrupted healthcare access and vaccination routines."

    "text": "1.4 Global Perspective and Future Directions\nBeyond the U.S., Harrison and Shonushka extended their analysis to a global context, examining measles case trends in regions like Africa. By fitting statistical models to historical data, they offered forecasts that capture both seasonal patterns and recent fluctuations. Their work demonstrated the complex interplay between vaccination coverage and case rates, revealing that even small declines in coverage can lead to significant increases in measles cases.\nIn closing, their presentation emphasized three key takeaways:\n\nThe persistent decline in U.S. MMR coverage and its public health implications.\nThe disparity between absolute case counts and relative growth rates in different regions.\nThe inverse correlation between vaccination coverage and measles incidence, highlighting the critical need for maintaining high vaccination rates."

    "text": "1.1 From Deterministic to Generative: A Paradigm Shift\nIn traditional machine learning (ML), models are deterministic – given the same input, they produce the same output. This predictability provides a clear framework for evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and others familiar to statisticians and data scientists. However, with the rise of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI, this predictability is challenged. These systems introduce non-determinism, meaning outputs can vary even with identical inputs, necessitating new evaluation frameworks.\nDr. LeDell emphasized that traditional accuracy-based metrics fall short when assessing generative AI systems. Instead, evaluation must consider coherence, consistency, and bias, along with the challenges of reproducibility in probabilistic AI systems. This shift leads to questions about how to ensure AI models are reliable and function as expected in real-world scenarios."

These data offer a high-resolution view of daily activity patterns, recorded across three axes (X, Y, Z) in milligravities. However, this study’s foundational challenge lies in its observational nature and reliance on self-reported outcomes to define vigilance states.\nVigilance and non-vigilance were distinguished using self-reported symptoms of narcolepsy and frequency of daytime naps. Non-vigilant participants reported narcolepsy symptoms often or always and took frequent naps, while vigilant participants did not report these symptoms or behaviors. Despite a robust overall dataset, the non-vigilant group comprised only 679 individuals, necessitating a careful matching process to ensure comparable analysis groups."

The CNN architecture included convolutional layers, max pooling, and dense layers with dropout to prevent overfitting. Training involved 20-fold cross-validation at the subject level, ensuring that predictions were genuinely out-of-sample.\nThe CNN yielded an out-of-sample F1 score of 0.576 and an AUC of 0.539 at the sample level for participants aged 65 or younger. At the subject level, the F1 score was 0.539, and the AUC was 0.564.

    "section": "1.1 Speaker: Joe Cheng",
    "text": "1.1 Speaker: Joe Cheng\nJoe Cheng, the CTO of Posit, PBC, stands at the forefront of this exploration. As the original creator of the Shiny web framework and co-creator of ellmer, Joe’s workshop at R/Medicine 2025 offered attendees a deep dive into the practical aspects of integrating LLMs with R. His journey from skepticism to embracing the potential of LLMs underscores a broader narrative within the data science community about the transformative power of these models when approached with curiosity and innovative tools.\n\n1.1.1 From Skepticism to Innovation\nA year and a half ago, the consensus at Posit leaned towards skepticism regarding the hype surrounding AI and LLMs. The concern centered around the models’ black box nature and their apparent incompatibility with the principles of reproducible research and transparent methodologies. However, the turning point for Joe and his team came with the realization that the capabilities of LLMs defied their initial understanding and skepticism. This led to a series of internal hackathons aimed at demystifying LLMs for Posit employees, fostering a profound appreciation for the models’ potential when accessed programmatically.\n\n\n1.1.2 The Workshop: A Practical Introduction to LLM APIs\nJoe’s workshop provided a comprehensive introduction to utilizing LLM APIs within the R ecosystem, leveraging the ellmer package. Attendees learned how to configure R to interact with LLMs, customize model behavior through system prompts, integrate chatbots into Shiny applications, and employ LLMs for advanced natural language processing tasks. This hands-on approach equipped participants with the knowledge to embark on their own experiments with LLMs, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in data analysis and application development.\n\n\n1.1.3 Key Takeaways\n\nProgrammatic Access to LLMs: The workshop emphasized the untapped potential of LLMs when accessed programmatically, allowing for more complex and tailored interactions than what standard interfaces like ChatGPT offer.\nIntegration with R: By showcasing the integration of LLMs with R, particularly through the ellmer package, Joe highlighted the seamless bridge between cutting-edge AI models and the robust analytical capabilities of R.\nEmpowering the R Community: The workshop not only showcased the technical possibilities but also served as a call to action for the R community to explore and innovate with LLMs, fostering a culture of experimentation and learning.\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Conclusion\nThe journey from skepticism to embracing LLMs underscores a larger narrative within the tech community about the potential of these models to revolutionize data analysis, application development, and beyond. Joe Cheng’s workshop at R/Medicine 2025 stands as a beacon for R enthusiasts eager to explore this new frontier, armed with the knowledge and tools to unlock the full capabilities of LLMs."

    "title": "In the Nix of Time: Creating a reproducible analytical environment with Nix and {rix}",
    "section": "",
    "text": "0.1 Turbocharging Shiny App Development with Nix and {rix}\nIn the realm of data science, particularly for medical research, the integration of open-source tools has dramatically accelerated the development and deployment of sophisticated analytical applications. Among these tools, R has established itself as a powerhouse for statistical computing and data visualization, especially with its ability to create interactive web applications using Shiny. However, as developers push the boundaries of what’s possible, ensuring reproducibility and handling complex dependencies become crucial challenges. This is where the Nix package manager and the {rix} R package, authored by Bruno Rodrigues and Philipp Baumann, come into play.\nEric Nantz, a seasoned statistician, developer, and the host of the R-Podcast, recently shared his insights at the R/Medicine 2025 conference on how these tools have revolutionized his workflow in developing robust production-quality Shiny applications. His demonstration highlighted the synergy between Nix and Shiny, presenting a compelling case for their combined use in data science projects.\n\n0.1.1 The Reproducibility Challenge\nShiny applications, while powerful, often require a myriad of dependencies. These range from R packages like {reactable} for table visualizations to system-level dependencies and external services such as APIs. Traditionally, tools like {renv} have been used to manage R package dependencies, while Docker has been employed to handle system-level dependencies. However, this combination can sometimes fall short, particularly in complex environments or when deploying across different systems.\n\n\n0.1.2 Enter Nix and {rix}\nThe Nix package manager offers a comprehensive solution by managing the full dependency stack of software projects. It provides a sandboxed environment where dependencies can be installed and managed without interfering with the host system. This is particularly advantageous for Shiny applications, which can have intricate dependencies spread across different languages and systems.\nThe {rix} package simplifies the integration of Nix with R projects. It allows developers to create project-specific sandboxes that include both R packages and system dependencies, all managed via Nix. This ensures that all team members can work in a consistent environment, reducing the “it works on my machine” syndrome.\n\n\n0.1.3 Key Features of Nix and {rix}\n\nComprehensive Package Management: Nix manages over 120,000 software packages, ensuring that all dependencies, including system libraries, are automatically resolved and installed.\nImmutable and Reproducible Environments: By creating an immutable file system, Nix ensures that the development environment remains consistent, preventing accidental changes that can affect reproducibility.\nCross-Platform Compatibility: Nix can be installed on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via Windows Subsystem for Linux), making it accessible to a wide range of users.\nIntegration with {rix}: The {rix} package allows easy configuration of R-specific environments, including access to CRAN and Bioconductor packages, as well as GitHub-hosted packages.\n\n\n\n0.1.4 Shiny and Nix: A Perfect Match\nEric Nantz’s demonstration showcased a Shiny application developed using the Nix and {rix} workflow. The app, which explored data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, was developed using the Golem package to convert the Shiny app into a package format—a best practice that enhances maintainability and scalability.\nOne of the standout features of this workflow was the ability to run a Shiny application with all its dependencies managed by Nix, without R being installed on the host system. This was possible through the use of a Nix shell, which provided a sandboxed environment where R and its packages were available. This not only ensured a consistent development environment but also facilitated easy deployment via Docker for hosting on cloud platforms.\n\n\n0.1.5 Overcoming Challenges\nWhile the benefits of using Nix and {rix} are substantial, there are some challenges to be aware of. The learning curve associated with Nix’s domain-specific language can be steep, and managing storage space for the Nix store is necessary. Additionally, some packages that write to temporary directories may not play well with Nix’s immutable file system. However, the advantages of reproducibility and ease of deployment often outweigh these hurdles.\n\n\n0.1.6 Conclusion\nThe integration of Nix and {rix} into Shiny app development represents a significant advancement in creating reproducible and scalable data science projects. By leveraging Nix’s powerful package management capabilities and {rix}’s seamless integration with R, developers can ensure their applications are robust, consistent, and easy to deploy across various environments.\nEric Nantz’s insights and demonstration provide a valuable resource for R developers looking to enhance their workflow with these cutting-edge tools. As the R community continues to innovate and evolve, the combination of Shiny, Nix, and {rix} is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of data science applications."

Traditional processes involve lengthy data transformations to make data research-ready, followed by the application of statistical methods. The introduction of a common data model, such as the OMOP CDM, simplifies this process by standardizing healthcare data. This allows researchers to focus on querying the standardized data to generate reliable evidence, without needing to handle the intricacies of data transformation themselves.\n\n1.1.1 Key Benefits of the OMOP Common Data Model:\n\nStandardization: Different source systems can be converted to the same common data model, enabling the use of consistent pipelines across various databases.\nInteroperability: The OMOP CDM allows for international network studies, where analytic code is distributed to data partners who run it locally, keeping patient data secure and aggregated results are shared.\nReproducibility: The common vocabulary and standardized format ensure that studies are reproducible across different geographies and healthcare systems."

    "section": "",
    "text": "0.1 Simplifying Bootstrap Inference in R with the boot.pval Package\nIn the realm of statistical analysis, ensuring the reliability of p-values and confidence intervals is paramount, especially when classical assumptions about data distribution do not hold. This is where bootstrap methods come into play, offering a robust alternative by relying on data-driven, empirical distributions rather than theoretical assumptions. Despite their utility, bootstrap methods are often underutilized due to perceived complexities in implementation. However, with advancements in R packages like boot.pval, bootstrap inference has become more accessible than ever.\n\n0.1.1 The Bootstrap Approach\nIntroduced by Bradley Efron in 1979, the bootstrap method revolutionizes statistical inference by focusing on the empirical distribution of the data itself. Unlike traditional methods that start with a distributional assumption (e.g., normality), bootstrap methods begin with the actual data distribution. By resampling from this empirical distribution and calculating the test statistic repeatedly, we obtain an accurate approximation of its distribution. This allows for the computation of p-values and confidence intervals without reliance on stringent assumptions about data normality.\n\n\n0.1.2 The Role of boot.pval\nThe boot.pval package in R, developed by Måns Thulin from Thulin Consulting AB, simplifies the process of applying bootstrap methods to a variety of statistical tests and models. From t-tests to regression coefficients in linear models, GLMs, survival models, and mixed models, boot.pval enables users to compute bootstrap p-values and confidence intervals efficiently—often with just a single line of code.\n\n\n0.1.3 Key Features and Benefits\n\nEase of Use: The package allows for straightforward computation of bootstrap p-values and confidence intervals without needing to write complex custom functions.\nIntegration: Built on top of established R packages like boot, car, lme4, and survival, it ensures compatibility and extends functionality.\nCustomizability: Users can create custom bootstrap tests for unique statistical measures.\nConsistency: It ensures that the derived p-values and confidence intervals are consistent, addressing discrepancies often found in other implementations.\n\n\n\n0.1.4 Practical Application: A Case Study\nUsing the sleep dataset in R, Thulin demonstrates how to replace a classic t-test with a bootstrap t-test using boot.pval. This approach not only simplifies the code but also enhances the robustness of the test against non-normal data distributions. The output from boot.pval mirrors that from traditional tests but is derived from a more reliable, data-centric approach.\n\n\n0.1.5 Extending Beyond Simple Tests\nThe boot.pval package is not limited to simple t-tests; it supports complex models including linear regressions and survival models. By fitting a model using standard R functions like lm() or glm(), users can then apply boot.summary() from boot.pval to obtain detailed summaries including estimates, confidence intervals, and p-values—all bootstrapped for enhanced reliability.\n\n\n0.1.6 Conclusion\nBootstrap methods provide a powerful tool for statistical inference when traditional assumptions do not hold. With packages like boot.pval, R users can integrate robust bootstrap techniques into their daily analysis workflows effortlessly. Whether dealing with straightforward comparisons or complex multivariable models, boot.pval offers a user-friendly yet powerful solution for making informed statistical decisions based on solid empirical evidence.\nFor those interested in delving deeper into bootstrap methods or seeking practical applications within R, exploring further resources such as Thulin’s book “Modern Statistics with R” or foundational texts on bootstrap methodology can be incredibly beneficial."

    "text": "1.2 Exploring the Correlates of Depression in Cancer Survivors\nDespite the established link between cancer and depression, there remains a critical need to explore the specific demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors contributing to this mental health burden. Previous research, often limited by smaller sample sizes, has struggled to generalize findings across the broader U.S. cancer survivor population. Addressing this gap, Williams and his team leveraged the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data, a robust, nationally representative resource, to examine these factors.\n\n1.2.1 Research Methodology\nThe study utilized NHIS data from 2022, focusing on individuals who reported a cancer diagnosis. The primary research question aimed to uncover the demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors associated with increased depressive symptomatology among these individuals. Depressive symptomatology was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8), with a score of 10 or higher indicating moderate or greater depressive symptoms.\nFor the analysis, various R packages, including survey, tidyverse, modelsummary, and data.table, were employed. The team conducted survey logistic regression to evaluate the associations between depressive symptoms and various independent variables.\n\n\n1.2.2 Key Findings\nThe analysis revealed several significant associations with moderate or greater depressive symptoms among cancer survivors:\n\nSocioeconomic Factors: Poverty, lower levels of education, and lack of private health insurance were significantly associated with increased depressive symptoms, highlighting the impact of financial and educational disparities on mental health.\nDemographic Factors: Female gender, younger age, and living alone were demographic variables linked to heightened depressive symptoms, suggesting a greater vulnerability among certain groups.\nHealthcare Access and Utilization: Delays in care, unmet care needs due to cost, frequent emergency visits, and overnight hospitalizations were associated with increased depressive symptoms. These findings underscore the importance of accessible and affordable healthcare in addressing mental health issues.\nCo-occurring Conditions: Mild or greater anxiety symptomatology was significantly associated with increased depressive symptoms, emphasizing the interconnectedness of mental health conditions."

By utilizing techniques like word embeddings, which are akin to the Word2Vec algorithm, the package allows researchers to analyze the relationships between different medical concepts as documented in clinician notes. This transformation helps in identifying patterns and correlations that might not be evident in codified data alone.\n\n\n1.4.2 kgraph: Visualizing Complex Data Relationships\nComplementing nlpembeds, the kgraph package offers powerful visualization capabilities for the data relationships uncovered through NLP analysis. By constructing knowledge graphs, researchers can visually explore the connections between various medical concepts, enhancing their ability to interpret complex data sets. This is particularly useful in mental health research, where understanding the interplay between different symptoms and diagnoses is crucial."

CKD is more common than cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and chronic respiratory conditions. Age-standardized rates for CKD have increased, unlike many other non-communicable diseases where rates have declined. This trend suggests a future increase in CKD cases. High-risk groups, such as individuals with diabetes, hypertension, and rheumatoid arthritis, show CKD prevalence rates ranging from 20% to 60%. Moreover, about 40% of those aged 65 and older live with CKD, underscoring its significance in geriatric care.\nCKD’s impact extends to pharmacotherapy, as kidneys play a pivotal role in drug elimination. Reduced kidney function necessitates dosage adjustments or contraindications for certain medications. Despite CKD’s high prevalence, patients with the condition are often excluded from clinical trials. A staggering 80% of cardiovascular medication trials exclude CKD patients, including 40% that exclude early-stage CKD patients."

    "section": "1 Ethical Choices in Regression Analysis: A Case Study from Seattle Children’s Hospital",
    "text": "1 Ethical Choices in Regression Analysis: A Case Study from Seattle Children’s Hospital\nIn the world of statistical modeling, the choice of coding schemes for categorical variables is not merely a technical consideration but a decision laden with ethical implications. This was the focus of a recent presentation during the R/Medicine 2025 conference by Dwight Barry, Principal Data Scientist at Seattle Children’s Hospital, and Nicole Chicoine, DO, MPH, also at Seattle Children’s Hospital. The talk revolved around how these choices can influence the inferences drawn from regression analyses and ultimately impact healthcare delivery and research.\n\n1.1 The Hospital’s Language Diversity\nSeattle Children’s Hospital is a bustling 400-bed facility that handles over half a million patient visits annually. With such a diverse patient base, the hospital encounters more than 130 languages, with Spanish being the most common after English. To accommodate this linguistic diversity, the hospital has initiated its first all-Spanish speaking operating room, ensuring equitable care for non-English speaking patients. This commitment to inclusivity is mirrored in their research methodologies, where the focus is on equitable outcomes across different patient groups.\n\n\n1.2 Understanding Coding Schemes\nThe choice of coding schemes in regression models is crucial as it can shape the conclusions drawn from the data. Barry highlighted three coding schemes used in R: treatment contrast, sum contrast, and weighted effect coding. Each scheme presents categorical variables in different ways, affecting the interpretation of the data.\n\nTreatment Contrast: This is the default coding in R, where one category is used as a reference against which others are compared. In a clinical setting, this could inadvertently privilege a particular group, often aligning with the English-speaking, white demographic, which can skew the narrative towards existing inequities.\nSum Contrast: Here, the grand mean of all categories is used as the reference point. This approach decouples any single category from being the norm, promoting a more balanced view. In the context of healthcare, it shifts the focus from a single dominant group to an aggregate understanding, which can be crucial in addressing biases.\nWeighted Effect Coding: This method is a variant of the sum contrast, where each category level is weighted by its sample size. Although not a built-in feature in base R, the wec package facilitates its implementation. This approach provides a nuanced view by factoring in the prevalence of each category, which can be especially useful in diverse patient populations.\n\n\n\n1.3 Implications for Healthcare Research\nThe choice of coding scheme is not just a statistical decision but an ethical one, as it affects how healthcare equity is perceived and addressed. Barry’s presentation underscored that while odds ratios may differ across coding schemes, the marginal effects remain consistent, suggesting that predictions are unaffected by these choices. However, the ethical ramifications are significant, as they influence which group is centered in the analysis.\nIn healthcare research, where categorical exposures like language group, race, or ethnicity lack a natural order, choosing the right coding scheme is vital. Sum contrasts, for instance, provide a means to avoid privileging any group, thereby promoting equity.\n\n\n1.4 Broader Implications and Recommendations\nBarry’s insights extend beyond surgery to any healthcare condition where equity is a concern. The presentation emphasized the importance of presenting marginal effects alongside regression coefficients or odds ratios to provide a comprehensive view of the data. By decentering from a single reference point, researchers can challenge the dominant social narratives and highlight systemic inequities, paving the way for more inclusive and equitable healthcare practices.\nIn conclusion, the ethical dimensions of statistical modeling are as crucial as the statistical ones. As healthcare becomes increasingly data-driven, recognizing and addressing these ethical considerations is essential. By adopting coding schemes that promote equity, researchers and healthcare providers can ensure that their work contributes to a more just and equitable healthcare system."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Note: This project is funded by the R Consortium\n\n1 Navigating Interruption: Forecasting Dengue Cases Amidst COVID-19\nDengue fever, a mosquito-borne disease, remains a significant health concern in tropical regions, particularly in countries near the equator. The dengue virus, primarily transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, thrives in warm, humid conditions with regular rainfall—conditions that are prevalent in these regions. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic introduced an unprecedented interruption in the usual dengue case patterns. This blog post delves into a study that explores how to accurately forecast dengue cases amidst the interruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, using Sri Lanka as a case study.\nUnderstanding the Interruption\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, several factors contributed to an unusual pattern in dengue case reporting. These include:\n\nMisclassification of dengue as COVID-19 due to overlapping symptoms such as fever, headache, and fatigue.\nUnderreporting or delayed reporting due to lockdowns and mobility restrictions.\nReduced human-mosquito contact due to people spending more time indoors.\nSchool and workplace closures, which are common sites for dengue transmission.\nTravel restrictions, which reduced the spread of dengue to new areas.\n\nThis period, referred to as the “interrupted period,” significantly affected the usual seasonal and annual patterns of dengue cases.\nForecasting Strategies\nThe study, presented by Thiyanga S. Talagala from the Department of Statistics at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka, investigates three modeling strategies to address this interruption in dengue case forecasting:\n\nExcluding the Interrupted Period: This approach involves using only post-COVID-19 data for model training, effectively ignoring the data from the interrupted period.\nForecasting the Interrupted Period First: This method involves forecasting the interrupted period based on data up to 2019, then using the updated time series for model training.\nDown-Weighting the Interrupted Period: This strategy assigns lower weights to data points in the interrupted period, giving higher weights to uninterrupted periods.\n\nData from 2007 to 2024 were used for model fitting, and data for 2025 served as the test set to evaluate the performance of these methods across 25 districts in Sri Lanka.\nEvaluating the Methods\nThe study employed various accuracy measures, including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), to compare the forecasting performance of each approach. The findings revealed that no single method outperformed across all districts. Instead, the effectiveness of each approach depended on the specific characteristics and historical patterns of each district.\nInsights and Implications\nThe study’s insights underscore the importance of tailoring forecasting methods to the unique characteristics of each region. For instance, the down-weighting approach proved effective in areas where the usual dengue patterns persisted despite the interruption. In contrast, excluding the interrupted period worked best in districts that had shifted to a new normal post-COVID-19.\nFurthermore, the study highlighted the influence of weather patterns on dengue transmission. Districts affected by specific monsoon periods or characterized by unique weather conditions showed distinct forecasting patterns.\nConclusion\nForecasting dengue cases amidst interruptions like COVID-19 is a complex task that requires adaptive approaches. The study by Talagala emphasizes that understanding the local context, including weather patterns and historical data, is crucial for accurate forecasting. This research not only contributes to improving dengue preparedness but also offers valuable insights for handling future public health interruptions.\nFor more detailed insights and to explore the methodologies used, you can access the project on GitHub and the main Dengue Data Hub site."

This systematic approach encodes metadata directly into variable names, providing immediate context and enhancing the clarity of the data.\n\n1.2.1 Example of Controlled Vocabulary\nConsider a scenario where you have a dataset with multiple tables, each containing various types of data. For instance, if you’re tracking whether patients had an eGFR lab test during a baseline period, a variable name following a controlled vocabulary might be labs_eGFR_baseline_ind, where ind stands for indicator. This descriptive naming convention helps users instantly understand the data stored in the column.\n\n\n1.2.2 Structured Naming and Its Advantages\nControlled vocabularies mandate a consistent format across the project, which can be crucial for downstream analyses. For example, a variable capturing the median value of an eGFR test might be named labs_eGFR_baseline_median_value, providing additional clarity such as the unit of measurement and the calculation method.\nThe benefits of controlled vocabularies extend to various facets of data analysis:\n\nRegular Expressions: With consistently named variables, regular expressions can efficiently query subsets of data, facilitating tasks like data validation and report generation.\nData Validation: By defining expected data types and constraints (e.g., numeric values for duration variables should be non-negative), controlled vocabularies simplify the validation process.\nStreamlined Workflows: Tasks such as creating summary tables, modeling, sensitivity analysis, and generating data dictionaries become more straightforward and reproducible."
