# Python has limited social science tools:
# - Basic statistical analysis
# - No specialized survey packages
# - Limited psychometric tools
# - No SEM packages
# - Basic network analysis
```

### Fragmented Ecosystem

Python's social science tools are scattered:

```python
# Python social science is fragmented:
# - No integrated platform
# - Limited documentation
# - Poor community support
# - No peer-reviewed packages
# - Basic implementations
```

## Performance Comparison

| Feature | R | Python |
|---------|---|--------|
