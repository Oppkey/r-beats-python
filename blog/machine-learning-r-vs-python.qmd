## Introduction

While Python dominates in deep learning and engineering-focused machine learning, R provides unique advantages through its statistical foundation. R's approach to machine learning emphasizes interpretability, statistical rigor, and research-grade implementations that complement Python's strengths.

## R's Statistical ML Foundation

### Built on Statistical Theory

R's machine learning is grounded in statistical theory:

```{r}
#| echo: true

# R's ML approach emphasizes:
# - Statistical interpretability
# - Model diagnostics
# - Uncertainty quantification
# - Research reproducibility
# - Academic rigor
```

### Research-Grade Implementations

R provides peer-reviewed machine learning packages:

```{r}
#| echo: true

# R's ML packages are:
# - Peer-reviewed
# - Published in statistical journals
# - Used in academic research
# - Well-documented
# - Statistically validated
```

## Statistical Learning with R

### Linear and Generalized Linear Models

R excels in statistical learning:

```{r}
#| echo: true

library(stats)
library(MASS)

# Linear models with comprehensive diagnostics
lm_model <- lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl + hp, data = mtcars)
summary(lm_model)

# Model diagnostics
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(lm_model)

# Stepwise selection
step_model <- stepAIC(lm_model, direction = "both")
```

### Generalized Additive Models

R provides sophisticated GAM implementations:

```{r}
#| echo: true

library(mgcv)
library(gam)

# Generalized additive models
gam_model <- gam(mpg ~ s(wt) + s(hp) + cyl, data = mtcars)

# Model summary with significance tests
summary(gam_model)

# Visualization of smooth terms
plot(gam_model, residuals = TRUE)
```

## Ensemble Methods

### Random Forests

R provides statistical random forest implementations:

```{r}
#| echo: true

library(randomForest)

# Random forest with statistical output
rf_model <- randomForest(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars, importance = TRUE)

# Variable importance with statistical significance
importance(rf_model)
varImpPlot(rf_model)

# Partial dependence plots
partialPlot(rf_model, mtcars, "wt")
```

### Gradient Boosting

R excels in statistical gradient boosting:

```{r}
#| echo: true

library(gbm)

# Gradient boosting with statistical diagnostics
# Adjusted parameters for small dataset
gbm_model <- gbm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars, 
                 distribution = "gaussian",
                 n.trees = 100,
                 interaction.depth = 2,
                 bag.fraction = 0.8,
                 n.minobsinnode = 3)

# Variable importance
summary(gbm_model)

# Partial dependence plots
plot(gbm_model, i.var = "wt")
```

## Model Diagnostics and Validation

### Cross-Validation

R provides comprehensive validation tools:

```{r}
#| echo: true

library(caret)
library(boot)

# Cross-validation with statistical rigor
cv_results <- cv.glm(mtcars, lm_model, K = 10)
cv_results$delta

# Caret for systematic model comparison
control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)
model_comparison <- train(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars, 
                         method = "rf",
                         trControl = control)
```

### Model Diagnostics

R excels in model diagnostics:

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Comprehensive model diagnostics
library(car)

# Residual analysis
residualPlots(lm_model)

# Influence diagnostics
influencePlot(lm_model)

# Multicollinearity
vif(lm_model)

# Normality tests
shapiro.test(residuals(lm_model))
```

## Bayesian Machine Learning

### Bayesian Models

R provides sophisticated Bayesian ML:

```{r}
#| echo: true

library(rstan)
library(brms)
library(rstanarm)

# Bayesian linear regression
bayes_model <- stan_glm(mpg ~ wt + cyl, data = mtcars,
                       family = gaussian(),
                       prior = normal(0, 10))
