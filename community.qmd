## Our Community

This site uses AI. But it is connected with the R Community and actively asks for comments, feedback, and contributions. The site is an experiment. We are leveraging AI to scale usable information and education around R. But by fully including the community, this information has confidence and authority that only comes from true human expertise.

AI is generating content at an unprecedented scale, but there's a major problem: it's often wrong. For technical content, 'wrong' isn't just embarrassing, it's negative value. A waste of time. In this experiment, we are solving this major issue by treating errors in AI content like bugs in software. We've essentially built a 'bug bounty' platform for content, connecting AI-generated articles to the global R community of vetted developers who get paid to find and fix inaccuracies.

The scale of AI with the trust of human verification, with the goal of creating scalable quality assurance in the AI era.

> Overall the R Beats Python site has a clear and thoughtful mission which is to “provide a reasoned and evidence-based comparison of R vs. python”. It argues, and makes a compelling case, for the future of R in statistical computing and research in the industries and academia with some examples and insights into specific areas. In general, the site seems well placed to serve as a resource for data professionals looking for more sophisticated options for picking tools.
>
> I think the article ([Statistical Modeling: Why R Outperforms Python](https://oppkey.github.io/r-beats-python/blog/statistical-modeling-r-vs-python.html)) is a technically capable and well written discussion of statistical modeling in R versus Python. It makes a case for R’s primacy in inferential statistics and somewhat acknowledges Python’s advancements. The Python-side would be more complete with some executable code snippets as well as a more thorough discussion of performance and specialized modeling scenarios, which would appeal to technically-oriented data professionals.

**Her opinion on the podcast:**

> The hosts have a solid grasp of R, not just in terms of its technical capabilities, but also more importantly, how and when it should be used in academia, providing great examples of situations in which R is and will remain necessary to many scholars. The discussion is at a sweet spot along the technical-to-accessible spectrum; it is technical enough to convey the message that R is good for specific things but does not imply that Python is uninviting. In summary, it is a well-produced and well-paced podcast that makes the case for R's continued place in the statistics academy in an interesting way.

> This is great, as the number of individuals trying to learn R is declining, and most people think R is meant for those in academia or Pharma. I think instead of showing R strengths, places where Python excel like llm development, prompt engineering, and AI agent development should be emphasized in R. Most individuals are not familiar that R can also do a lot of these things.
>
> Web development should not also be left behind, like developing APIs and backend applications with R.

**His recommendations to improve content:**

> The article ([Statistical Modeling: Why R Outperforms Python](https://oppkey.github.io/r-beats-python/blog/statistical-modeling-r-vs-python.html)) lacks proper explanation of what's happening in the code, and there is not test to actually measure the strengths and weakness of Python and R.

**His opinion on the podcast:**

> I like the podcast, and it's clear and interactive. The presenters explained a lot of the strengths of R.
